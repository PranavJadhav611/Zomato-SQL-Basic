# Zomato-SQL-Basic_to_Intermediate


**Project Overview:**
This repository hosts a comprehensive project that demonstrates foundational to intermediate SQL coding techniques. It encompasses a wide array of functionalities, ranging from table creation and data insertion to advanced operations such as table joins and the utilization of Common Table Expressions (CTEs).


**Steps taken in the Project**


**1) Creating tables:**
In this project, I have meticulously crafted four tables to demonstrate the process of table creation in SQL. These tables are meticulously designed to showcase best practices in database schema development and serve as a foundation for further exploration of SQL querying and manipulation techniques.

Below are the screen shots of the tables which I have created manually.

1) Sales Table:

2) Product Table:

**Questions to be answered using the created tables.**

1)What is total amount each customer spent on Zomato ?

2)What is total amount each customer spent Product wise on Zomato ?

3)How many days has each customer visited Zomato ?

4)What is the first product purchased by each customer ?

5)What is the most purchased item and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

6)WHich is the most favourite product for each customer ?




**In this project, I've demonstrated the effective utilization of SQL joins and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to facilitate data merging and streamline complex query operations and answer above questions.**
